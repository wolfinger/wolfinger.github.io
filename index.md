# Hello!
I am a [finance Senior Director](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wolfinger) at Qualcomm, but am looking for a junior backend software engineering role. You may be surprised by this, so a little background may help:<br>
<br>
I taught myself BASIC in 4th grade, ran a website development business in high school, and deferred my first semester of college to work at an ecommerce startup. I was a double major in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu) and [Business Information Systems](https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu), but dropped CS after two years (at 20 I didn’t think I wanted to be a developer).<br>
<br>
My first job out of college was data integration consulting with [Informatica](https://www.informatica.com), a leading data platform. However, I refocused my career on finance after reading [Fooled by Randomness](https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto-ebook/dp/B001FA0W5W) which led me down the path to where I am today.<br>
<br>
In 2016 I started a hedge fund and taught myself Python so I could analyze large macroeconomic + financial data sets, and manage my portfolio. Although my fund didn’t work out, I [open sourced some of the code](https://github.com/wolfinger/outcomes) and rekindled my love for software.<br>
<br>
Shortly into the pandemic I started learning [Go](https://go.dev) and designed + built an [investment management platform](https://github.com/wolfinger/varangian.public) with a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API using Go, [gRPC](https://grpc.io), [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org). It was such a fun project to work on and a great way to spend the time stuck at home.<br>
<br>
Over the past three years I’ve thought deeply about what I want out of my career. I can’t wait to finish my workday and for the weekends so I can spend time on software engineering. I am ready to turn this passion for software into my profession.<br>
<br>
While making a switch this far into a career is not the norm, it is not unprecedented. In addition to discussions with several people who have done just this, I also found some great resources online  (e.g., [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26383366) and [here](https://rodrigohgpontes.github.io/)).<br>
<br>
No doubt there will be a learning curve, but I have spent my entire life intrinsically driven by learning. I recently became an [AWS Certified Developer](https://www.credly.com/badges/cd67ac66-dac2-4418-97c5-627cbf147a39), have some relevant past work experience, and hopefully you see signal from me spending my free time on software engineering (some examples [here](relevant.experience.md) and my resume [here](resume.pdf)).<br>
<br>
I will work hard, learn quickly, collaborate well, and become a meaningful contributor that brings enthusiasm to the team. I look forward to chatting.<br>
<br>
