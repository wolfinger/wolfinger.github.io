### Personal Projects

#### [Varangian](https://github.com/wolfinger/varangian.public). Shopify + AWS of investment management.

The capital markets often devolve into a value extractive game. I wanted to create an investment management platform that focused on generating value for the users rather than the platform (a concept known as [the Bill Gates Line](https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line)).<br>
<br>
I used this project to learn [Go](https://go.dev) and deepen my understanding of [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API design (found [this great book](https://www.manning.com/books/api-design-patterns) along the way). Through research I settled on using [gRPC](https://grpc.io) and [protocol buffers (protobufs)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) as well â€“ a beautiful thing about gRPC is that it provides both RPC and HTTP gateways without any additional development work. Protobufs also fit very nicely with implementing a REST API design.<br>

#### [Outcomes](https://github.com/wolfinger/outcomes). Better data analysis for finance.

A Python package to assist with better financial market data and investment performance analysis. The package heavily uses well known data analysis packages [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org), [Numpy](https://numpy.org), and [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html). I wrote this initially for myself when launching a hedge fund and then [open sourced it](https://github.com/wolfinger/outcomes) later. Open sourcing the code taught me better documentation and testing skills. I admittedly have not put in much effort to generate interest and adoption by the community. If you build it, they will come just ain't so!<br>
<br>

#### [Algos](https://github.com/wolfinger/algos) and [Algos.Java](https://github.com/wolfinger/algos.java). Implementation of common algorithms and data structures.

Using the book [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Guide-Structures-Algorithms-Second-ebook-dp-B08KYMK4NR/dp/B08KYMK4NR) by Jay Wengrow, implemented common data structures ([stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)), [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree), [heaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)), [tries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie), [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)), etc.) and algorithms ([quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort), [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm), [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)/[BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search), [Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm), etc.) in Go. Then refactored the code to learn Java.<br>
<br>

#### [Midtide](https://github.com/wolfinger/midtide). Books time on your Google calendar based on Surfline conditions.

I wanted to brush up on Python and learn how to interact with the Google Calendar and Surfline APIs. What better way to do that than write an app that will book time on my gCal when [surf conditions in Pacific Beach](https://www.surfline.com/surf-report/pacific-beach/5842041f4e65fad6a7708841) look good?<br>
